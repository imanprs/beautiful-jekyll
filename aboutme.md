subtitle: Everything you don't really need to know

Here are a few things about me:

- I live in different time zones at different points in time, without moving.
- The only thing I don't procrastinate is procrastination.
- There are a great number of languages I *don't* speak.
- I have occasionally been called a good cook.

Anything else that you don't need to know?
